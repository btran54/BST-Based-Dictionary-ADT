2024 Winter CSE101 PA7

Goal:=============================================================================

Our goal in this project we will create a program that is very similar in operation to pa1, this time in C++. The main program will be called Order.c, and will use a Dictionary ADT based on a Binary Search Tree. The Dictionary ADT maintains a set of pairs whose members are called key and value, respectively. A state of this ADT is a set (possibly empty) of such pairs. 

Files:=============================================================================

Dictionary.h - Dictionary header file constaining the forward declaration of Dictionary functions

Dictionary.cpp - Dictionary CPP file containing the operation of functions

DictionaryTest.cpp - Dictionary test file containing tests for the operations from Dictionary.cpp

Order.cpp - Order file containing the main execution of Dictionary functions

Makefile - File used to automate build process

README.md - Documentation of included files
